ðŸŽ¬ Cinema Sales Analysis Project ðŸ“Š

Data science and machine learning project built as part of the Tuwaiq Academy â€“ Week Two Bootcamp Project.
The project focuses on analyzing a cinema ticket sales dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), applying statistical tests using StatsModels, and building predictive models to estimate sales performance.
An interactive Streamlit dashboard allows users to visualize insights and interact with predictions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
	â€¢	Exploring cinema sales dataset (cleaning, handling missing values/outliers).
	â€¢	Performing EDA with visualizations to uncover sales patterns.
	â€¢	Applying statistical analysis with StatsModels:
	â€¢	Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std).
	â€¢	Hypothesis testing (T-test: weekend vs weekday).
	â€¢	Correlation analysis (ticket price vs total sales).
	â€¢	Building Linear Regression (OLS) model.
	â€¢	Residual analysis (model diagnostics).
	â€¢	Building predictive models for ticket sales.
	â€¢	Deploying an interactive dashboard with Streamlit.
	â€¢	Delivering results in a clear and practical interface.
